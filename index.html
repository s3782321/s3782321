											Background info: Hi, I was born in Australia, however my parents were both born from Vietnam, therefore having a Vietnamese background. This therefore means that I can speak English and a little bit of Vietnamese. My highest education achievement to date was successfully completing VCE in 2018. Something I do to pass the time is play computer games, such as League of Legends and Rocket League. Other things also include watching Netflix and hanging out with friends.

										<h3>My Interest in IT</h3>
										<p>My interest in IT has sparked from various areas from the consumer electronics industry. This started at a young age, where I enjoyed having the latest in technology in order to do things that were new and revolutionary. My interest in technology ranges from new PC components to new smartphone releases and improvements in smartphone technology. An event that has particularly sparked my interest recently was the Samsung unpacked event, where they announced the new Galaxy devices. The event included new electronics that was not seen in the market before, which sparked my interest. However, I do not have any IT experience at the moment, other than knowing how to use the Microsoft Office suite on a basic level.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style3 fa-copy"></span>
										<h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
										<p>I chose to come to RMIT because I have heard that they have a reputation in the field of IT, and that it was one of the most popular courses available for IT. This high reputation would hopefully make it easier to obtain a career after completing the course. Another key factor in choosing RMIT is the location of the campus. The convenience of having campus right in the centre of the CBD allows for easier travel schedules, with lots of facilities and services nearby.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style5 fa-diamond"></span>
										<h3>Learning Expectations at RMIT</h3>
										<p>I expect to learn various sides of the IT industry during my course, ranging from programming to applying IT to real life businesses. Learning about the basics such as designing a good interface and working in a team environment are some skills that would be good to learn for the real world. I also want to learn multiple sides of IT, such as basic networking and basic programming to explore interests and find which part of IT I want to specialise in the future.

Also, this appeals to me because you are the person who organises and develops IT solutions in order to meet key objectives of the business, having a high contribution value to the fulfillment of the goals. <br>
								Key skills, qualifications and experience that is needed for becoming a Systems Analyst, is to have basic knowledge of user needs and business objectives, being able to analyse and research effectively to create solutions to problems and having strong communications skills in order to implement the plans. Qualifications that may be needed is having a degree completed related to information technology or business. <br>
								Currently, skills that I have include the ability to be organised and keep up with demands. I also have worked in a business environment for a few months, knowing how businesses operate which may be relevant in becoming a systems analyst. <br>
								In order to obtain the relevant skills, qualifications and experience needed, completing my university degree (Bachelor of Information Technology) should give myself enough skills and qualifications. For example, completing group assignments will give me communication skills in a group environment. Also, completing research assignments will be handy in order obtain skills in researching effectively.

									<p><br>
								The result of the online Myers-Briggs test indicates that my personality time is a ‘Defender’ type. This indicates that I have good analytical abilities, and good people skills, however, are receptive to change. The results of the learning style test indicate that I am mostly a visual learner, indicating that I learn best from looking at images. The results of the big 5 personality test indicate that I am more cooperative than competitive.  The result of these tests indicates the strengths and flaws about my personality, which can be used to find areas to improve as a person throughout my lifetime. Also, with these flaws, I can work on fixing them in a team environment, benefit not just myself but everyone in the group. With the online test results from yourself and others, you can figure out who would be a good match for each other, therefore improving workflow.
